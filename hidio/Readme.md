This is a patched version of hidio external, as the current vesrion (found here https://puredata.info/downloads/hidio/releases/0.1) is incompatible with Multi-touch (MT) Protocol (version B) touchscreens.

(for an explanation of the protocol, see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/multi-touch-protocol.txt)
